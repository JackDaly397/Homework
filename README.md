The data used in this pipeline is provided by NYC Open Data. It contains attendance results for students in public schools, charter schools, and home schooling across NYC. 

With this information, we can analyze the number of days students are absent by each school, year, grade, type of school, and demographic.

This type of information can provide helpful insight into where New York City can focus resources to ensure the education levels of the next generations remain high.
